  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - Fresh herbs (optional)

- Step-by-step instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Place them on a baking dish.
3. In a separate bowl, toss the diced potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them on a baking sheet in a single layer.
4. Place the baking dish with the chicken and the baking sheet with the potatoes in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, heat some olive oil in a pan and add the sliced onions. Cook over low heat until caramelized, about 15-20 minutes.
6. After the initial 20 minutes of baking, add the caramelized onions on top of the chicken and drizzle balsamic vinegar.
7. Continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are crispy on the edges.
8. Serve the baked chicken with roasted potatoes and caramelized onions, garnish with fresh herbs if desired. Enjoy!","","",""
